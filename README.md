### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a security engineer currently working at Hashicorp. I've worked in a variety of different security domains including application security, detection and response, malware analysis, and infrastructure security.

I love puzzles, and used to participate in a lot of CTF competitions. I also helped organize a few - working on both the challenge infrastructure and the challenges.

Some personal work I am proud of:
* My CTF challenges, particularly the [Dungeon](https://github.com/eastebry/ncurses-dungeon) and [Rotaluklak](https://github.com/p4-team/ctf/tree/master/2018-04-15-bsidessf/pwn_rotaluklak) challenges from BSidesSF 2018.
* The CTF infrastructure I helped develop for BSidesSF CTF [2017](https://github.com/BSidesSF/ctf-2017-release) and 2018.
* My obsession from the Covid19 days: a [rom hacking tool](https://github.com/eastebry/AdvanceWarsRomHackingToolkit) that allowed me and my friend to make better versions of the classic Gameboy Advance Game: Advance Wars 2. (We played _a lot_).
